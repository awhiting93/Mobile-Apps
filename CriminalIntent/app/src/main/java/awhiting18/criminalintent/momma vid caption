Dear Momma,
We love you so much.
You birthed us...
Doctored us...
Took us to every ball game...
Planned every beautiful vacation...
Taught us to serve the Lord...
Took all the pictures...(which made it hard to find ones of you)
Planned every birthday party...
Even for kids who didn't have their whole family together...
Sacrified things for yourself in order to get things for us...
Made Christmas special for those who didn't have Christmas...
Acted goofy with us...
Taught us to love each other...
Took us to the ER on Memorial Day...
Came to every graduation...
Made every Christmas absolutely beautiful...
And never once complained...

You and Daddy have given so much and asked for so little in return. 
Every Christmas you spent hours of your time finding gifts for us without
even thinking about yourself. Every Christmas you watched with joy as we
opened gifts with smiles on our face. You have always taken more joy out
of giving than receiving. You have always put others before yourself. I got teary
eyed when you texted me about Christmas presents early in the morning. It made
me realize that no matter how old we get, you still want us to have the best Christmas
even if you don't know what to get us anymore. You and Daddy have given so much
that we could never possibly repay you. But this Christmas break, we want to do
a little something in return for you.
We know that the two of you don't get much time to just be together without
worrying about the cost. So we have decided to pay your way to stay in a nice hotel
(or cabin) somewhere for one night this Christmas break. We will pay for your gas, food,
and lodging. You don't have to worry about paying for a penny of it. Just enjoy
yourselves. We love you so, so, so, so much!

Love,
Your Children
