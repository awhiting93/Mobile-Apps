[Enter <a href="cast.html#Alonso">Alonso</a>, <a href="cast.html#Sebastian">Sebastian</a>, <a href="cast.html#Antonio">Antonio</a>, <a href="cast.html#Gonzalo">Gonzalo</a>, <a href="cast.html#Adrian">Adrian</a>, <a href="cast.html#Fransisco">Francisco</a>]

   GONZALO
      [To ALONSO]
       <a href="commentary.html#note01">By'r lakin</a>, I can go no further, sir;
       My old bones ache: here's a maze trod indeed
       Through <a href="commentary.html#note03">forth-rights</a> and meanders! By your patience,
       I needs must rest me.

   ALONSO 
       Old lord, I cannot blame thee,
       Who am myself <a href="commentary.html#note05">attach'd</a> with weariness,
       To the <a href="commentary.html#note06">dulling</a> of my spirits: sit down, and rest.
       <a href="commentary.html#note07">Even</a> here I will put off my hope and keep <a href="commentary.html#note07(2)">it</a>
       No longer for my <a href="commentary.html#note08">flatterer</a>: he is drown'd
       Whom thus we stray to find, and the sea mocks
       Our <a href="commentary.html#note10">frustrate</a> search on land. Well, let him go.

   ANTONIO 
       [Aside to SEBASTIAN]
       I am right glad that he's so out of hope.
       Do not, for one <a href="commentary.html#note12">repulse</a>, forego the purpose
       That you resolved to effect.

   SEBASTIAN 
       [Aside to ANTONIO]
       The next advantage Will we take throughly.

   ANTONIO 
       [Aside to SEBASTIAN] 
       Let it be to-night;
       For, <a href="commentary.html#note15">now</a> they are oppress'd with <a href="commentary.html#note15">travail</a>, they
       Will not, nor cannot, use such vigilance
       As when they are fresh.

   SEBASTIAN 
       [Aside to ANTONIO]
       I say, to-night: no more.

       Solemn and strange music

   ALONSO 
       What harmony is this? My good friends, hark!

   GONZALO 
       Marvellous sweet music!

[Enter <a href="cast.html#Prospero">PROSPERO</a> above, invisible. Enter several strange Shapes, bringing in a banquet; 
they dance about it with gentle actions of salutation; and, inviting the King and company
to eat, they depart]

   ALONSO 
       Give us kind <a href="commentary.html#note20">keepers</a>, heavens! What were these?

   SEBASTIAN 
       A <a href="commentary.html#note21">living drollery.</a> Now I will believe
       That there are unicorns, that in Arabia
       There is one tree, the phoenix' throne, one phoenix
       At this hour reigning there.

   ANTONIO 
       I'll believe both;
       And <a href="commentary.html#note25">what</a> does else want <a href="commentary.html#note25">credit</a>, come to me,
       And I'll be sworn 'tis true: <a href="commentary.html#note26">travellers</a> ne'er did
       <a href="commentary.html#note26">lie</a>,
       Though fools at home condemn 'em.

   GONZALO 
       If in Naples
       I should report this now, would they believe me?
       If I should say, I saw such islanders--
       For, <a href="commentary.html#note30">certes</a>, these are people of the island--
       Who, though they are of monstrous shape, yet, note,
       Their manners are more <a href="commentary.html#note32">gentle-kind</a> than of
       Our human generation you shall find
       Many, nay, almost any.

   PROSPERO 
       [Aside] Honest lord,
       Thou hast said well; for some of you there present
       Are worse than devils.

ALONSO

    I cannot too much muse
    Such shapes, such gesture and such sound, expressing,
    Although they want the use of tongue, a kind
    Of excellent dumb discourse.

PROSPERO

    [Aside] Praise in departing.

FRANCISCO

    They vanish'd strangely.

SEBASTIAN

    No matter, since
    They have left their viands behind; for we have stomachs.
    Will't please you taste of what is here?

ALONSO

    Not I.

GONZALO

    Faith, sir, you need not fear. When we were boys,
    Who would believe that there were mountaineers
    Dew-lapp'd like bulls, whose throats had hanging at 'em
    Wallets of flesh? or that there were such men
    Whose heads stood in their breasts? which now we find
    Each putter-out of five for one will bring us
    Good warrant of.

ALONSO

    I will stand to and feed,
    Although my last: no matter, since I feel
    The best is past. Brother, my lord the duke,
    Stand to and do as we.

    [Thunder and lightning. Enter <a href="cast.html#Ariel">ARIEL</a>, like a harpy; claps his wings upon the table; and, with a quaint device, the banquet vanishes]

ARIEL

    You are three men of sin, whom Destiny,
    That hath to instrument this lower world
    And what is in't, the never-surfeited sea
    Hath caused to belch up you; and on this island
    Where man doth not inhabit; you 'mongst men
    Being most unfit to live. I have made you mad;
    And even with such-like valour men hang and drown
    Their proper selves.

    ALONSO, SEBASTIAN & c. draw their swords
    You fools! I and my fellows
    Are ministers of Fate: the elements,
    Of whom your swords are temper'd, may as well
    Wound the loud winds, or with bemock'd-at stabs
    Kill the still-closing waters, as diminish
    One dowle that's in my plume: my fellow-ministers
    Are like invulnerable. If you could hurt,
    Your swords are now too massy for your strengths
    And will not be uplifted. But remember--
    For that's my business to you--that you three
    From Milan did supplant good Prospero;
    Exposed unto the sea, which hath requit it,
    Him and his innocent child: for which foul deed
    The powers, delaying, not forgetting, have
    Incensed the seas and shores, yea, all the creatures,
    Against your peace. Thee of thy son, Alonso,
    They have bereft; and do pronounce by me:
    Lingering perdition, worse than any death
    Can be at once, shall step by step attend
    You and your ways; whose wraths to guard you from--
    Which here, in this most desolate isle, else falls
    Upon your heads--is nothing but heart-sorrow
    And a clear life ensuing.

    [He vanishes in thunder; then, to soft music enter the Shapes again, and dance, with mocks and mows, and carrying out the table]

PROSPERO

    Bravely the figure of this harpy hast thou
    Perform'd, my Ariel; a grace it had, devouring:
    Of my instruction hast thou nothing bated
    In what thou hadst to say: so, with good life
    And observation strange, my meaner ministers
    Their several kinds have done. My high charms work
    And these mine enemies are all knit up
    In their distractions; they now are in my power;
    And in these fits I leave them, while I visit
    Young <a href="cast.html#Ferdinand">Ferdinand</a>, whom they suppose is drown'd,
    And his and mine loved darling.

    [Exit above]

GONZALO

    I' the name of something holy, sir, why stand you
    In this strange stare?

ALONSO

    O, it is monstrous, monstrous:
    Methought the billows spoke and told me of it;
    The winds did sing it to me, and the thunder,
    That deep and dreadful organ-pipe, pronounced
    The name of Prosper: it did bass my trespass.
    Therefore my son i' the ooze is bedded, and
    I'll seek him deeper than e'er plummet sounded
    And with him there lie mudded.

    [Exit]

SEBASTIAN

    But one fiend at a time,
    I'll fight their legions o'er.

ANTONIO

    I'll be thy second.

   [<a href="commentary.html#note42">Exeunt</a> SEBASTIAN, and ANTONIO]

GONZALO

    All three of them are desperate: their great guilt,
    Like poison given to work a great time after,
    Now 'gins to bite the spirits. I do beseech you
    That are of suppler joints, follow them swiftly
    And hinder them from what this ecstasy
    May now provoke them to.

ADRIAN

    Follow, I pray you.

    [Exeunt]
